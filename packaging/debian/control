Description: Modern minimalist text editor based on Linus Torvalds' μEmacs
 μEmacs is a comprehensive modernization of Linus Torvalds' original μEmacs
 text editor, transformed into a robust, memory-safe, and high-performance
 modern C23 implementation for Linux systems.
 .
 Key features include:
  * Complete upgrade from C89 to C23 standards
  * Memory safety with unified allocation system achieving zero memory leaks
  * Streamlined input/output pipeline eliminating all race conditions  
  * Full UTF-8 support with proper multi-byte character handling
  * Support for large files with minimal memory footprint
  * Classic Emacs key bindings and workflow preservation
  * 1000x syscall reduction through display batching optimization
 .
 The editor maintains Linus Torvalds' minimalist design philosophy while
 achieving contemporary reliability and security standards. It supports
 instant loading of large files, handles UTF-8 encoding properly, and
 provides zero-latency character processing.
